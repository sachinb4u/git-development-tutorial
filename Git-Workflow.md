## Git workflow
Because of most of the reasons above, we use [Feature-branch-workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows#feature-branch-workflow) with [Interactive Rebasing](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/merging-vs-rebasing#the-golden-rule-of-rebasing) and some elements of [Gitflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows#gitflow-workflow) (naming and having a develop branch). The main steps are as follows:

* For a new project, initialize a git repository in the project directory. __For subsequent features/changes this step should be ignored__.
   ```sh
   cd <project directory>
   git init
   ```

* Checkout a new feature/bug-fix branch.
    ```sh
    git checkout -b <branchname>
    ```
* Make Changes.
    ```sh
    git add
    git commit -a
    ```
    _Why:_
    > `git commit -a` will start an editor which lets you separate the subject from the body. Read more about it in *section 1.3*.

* Sync with remote to get changes you’ve missed.
    ```sh
    git checkout develop
    git pull
    ```
    
    _Why:_
    > This will give you a chance to deal with conflicts on your machine while rebasing(later) rather than creating a Pull Request that contains conflicts.
    
* Update your feature branch with latest changes from develop by interactive rebase.
    ```sh
    git checkout <branchname>
    git rebase -i --autosquash develop
    ```
    
    _Why:_
    > You can use --autosquash to squash all your commits to a single commit. Nobody wants many commits for a single feature in develop branch. [read more...](https://robots.thoughtbot.com/autosquashing-git-commits)
    
* If you don’t have conflict skip this step. If you have conflicts, [resolve them](https://help.github.com/articles/resolving-a-merge-conflict-using-the-command-line/)  and continue rebase.
    ```sh
    git add <file1> <file2> ...
    git rebase --continue
    ```
* Push your branch. Rebase will change history, so you'll have to use `-f` to force changes into the remote branch. If someone else is working on your branch, use the less destructive `--force-with-lease`.
    ```sh
    git push -f
    ```
    
    _Why:_
    > When you do a rebase, you are changing the history on your feature branch. As a result, Git will reject normal `git push`. Instead, you'll need to use the -f or --force flag. [read more...](https://developer.atlassian.com/blog/2015/04/force-with-lease/)
    
    
* Make a Pull Request.
* Pull request will be accepted, merged and close by a reviewer.
* Remove your local feature branch if you're done.

  ```sh
  git branch -d <branchname>
  ```
  to remove all branches which are no longer on remote
  ```sh
  git fetch -p && for branch in `git branch -vv | grep ': gone]' | awk '{print $1}'`; do git branch -D $branch; done
  ```
