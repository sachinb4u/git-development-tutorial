## GitHub Forking workflow

Once you have setup a forked repository. Following are the steps to follow for the development

## Forking a Repository [GitHub Guides](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/)


A fork is a copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.

Most commonly, forks are used to either propose changes to someone else's project or to use someone else's project as a starting point for your own idea.

### Proposing Changes to Someone Else's Project
A great example of using forks to propose changes is for bug fixes. Rather than logging an issue for a bug you've found, you can:

1. Fork the repository. Refer https://github.wdf.sap.corp/OmniChannelBanking/git-demo/wiki/GitHub-Forked-Repository-Setup
2. Make the fix.
3. Submit a pull request to the project owner.

If the project owner likes your work, they might pull your fix into the original repository!

## GitHub Review Process
As of GitHub 2.8 GitHub comes with its own built-in review process. In the following this is explained.

### Starting a Review
To start a review on a pull request...

1. Open the Files changes tab in GitHub,
2. Leave comments on the code,
3. Select Start a review when finished. You can continue to leave multiple comments on the code.

Once finished you can Review changes, select an option, and finally Submit review. Your options are as follows:

* **Comment** - Comments do not require a review!
* **Approve** - Approves the pull request, equivalent to a Gerrit +1
* **Request** changes - Indicates that something needs to be resolved before merging to a Gerrit -1
